# SocialSummarizer
As a geek myself, I find that I often am talking about AI more than I am talking about anything else. So I challenged myself to write this code in 30 minutes to see if I could build a simple social summarizer bot.

##Installation
Use this command to install everything (I think, may need to include some composio libraries and do your own OAUTH).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
##Usage
It will summarize the top 10 trends for Gen Z and send it to your email upon running it, honestly pretty quickly and without too much money in cost (used GPT 4o mini search preview instead of something better like Perplexity Sonar).

##Questions
