# SocialSummarizer
As a geek myself, I find that I often am talking about AI more than I am talking about anything else. So I challenged myself to write this code in 30 minutes to see if I could build a simple social summarizer bot.

##Installation
Use this command to install everything (I think, may need to include some composio libraries and do your own OAUTH).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
